# Instructions to add programs (/programs)

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

For program(s) to be included into the portal, please provide information and ignore/delete those fields which are not applicable (this makes sense for single/few mainly static scripts). 

If your programs are updated regularily, e.g. new macros/scripts are added, then a crawling program which creates the final structure and content is recommended. I prefere SAS, R or Python scripts for this task. If you could provide a script, then I can schedule regular updates. If you have a bunch of related open-source programs, I can also create a corresponding crawling, please let me know the location of the scripts/programs folder to include via a [new issue](https://github.com/KatjaGlassConsulting/clinicalOpenSourcePortal/issues/new).

The following example shows all currently supported fields and is available under [/tools/reindeer.json](./tools/reindeer.json):

```json
```
